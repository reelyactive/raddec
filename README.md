RADio DECoding packet library for RFID, RTLS and M2M
----------------------------------------------------

A __raddec__ is an open-standard representation of a radio decoding.  This library provides functionality to manipulate __raddec__s as JSON and to convert to/from their binary representation.

Motivation
----------

Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID), Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) communications share several key properties:
- transmitters transmit packets that may be received by one or more receivers
- each transmitter and receiver has its own identifier
- each received packet produces metadata including a timestamp and a Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI)

For a broad range of applications, it is useful to identify, to locate and to collect sensed data from wireless devices, and this __raddec__ library is developed with the intent of providing a protocol-agnostic means of representing and efficiently transferring such information across networks.


Overview
--------

A __raddec__ has two forms: an _encoded_ form in which it has a strict binary representation, and a _decoded_ form in which it typically has a less-restrictive JSON representation.  The JSON representation is as follows:

```javascript
{
  transmitterId: "aabbccddeeff",
  transmitterIdType: 2,
  rssiSignature: [{
      receiverId: "001bc50940810000",
      receiverIdType: 1,
      rssi: -69,
      numberOfDecodings: 3
  }],
  packets: [ /* As hexadecimal strings */ ],
  timestamp: 1343392496789
}
```

This library provides functionality to _encode_ a __raddec__, typically in anticipation of network transport to a destination computer, and to _decode_ the same __raddec__, typically to facilitate manipulation and storage of the contained information.

### Hello raddec!

```javascript
const Raddec = require('raddec');

// The minimal raddec includes simply a transmitter identifier and type
let raddec = new Raddec({ 
    transmitterId: "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff",
    transmitterIdType: Raddec.identifiers.TYPE_EUI48
});

// One or more decodings by receivers are typically added
raddec.addDecoding({
    receiverId: "00-1b-c5-09-40-81-00-00",
    receiverIdType: Raddec.identifiers.TYPE_EUI64,
    rssi: -69
});

// Encoding results in a compact representation
let encoded = raddec.encodeAsHexString();
console.log(encoded);
// -> 10001702aabbccddeeff013a0101001bc509408100000b (23 bytes)

// Decoding restores a standard, easy-to-manipulate JSON object
raddec = new Raddec(encoded);

// A trim prunes any non-standard properties, adds timestamp if none present
raddec.trim();
console.log(raddec);
// {
//    transmitterId: "aabbccddeeff",
//    transmitterIdType: 2,
//    rssiSignature: [{
//        receiverId: "001bc50940810000",
//        receiverIdType: 1,
//        rssi: -69,
//        numberOfDecodings: 1
//    }],
//    timestamp: 1343392496789
//  }

// Flattening creates a JSON object suitable for storage/search/retrieval,
//   with the default options shown below
let options = {
    includePackets: true,        // Applicable when packets property is present
    includeRssiSignature: false, // Note that the rssiSignature is NOT flat
    maxNumberOfReceivers: 15,    // Only considered if
    rssiThreshold: -127          //   includeRssiSignature is true
};
let flattened = raddec.toFlattened(options);
console.log(flattened);
// {
//    transmitterId: "aabbccddeeff",
//    transmitterIdType: 2,
//    receiverId: "001bc50940810000",
//    receiverIdType: 1,
//    rssi: -69,
//    numberOfDecodings: 1,
//    numberOfReceivers: 1,
//    timestamp: 1343392496789
//  }

```


Properties
----------

A __raddec__ _must_ include the following mandatory properties and _may_ include any or all of the following optional properties.

### Mandatory Properties

A __raddec__ includes the following three mandatory properties in both its _encoded_ (binary) and _decoded_ (JSON) form.

| Property          | Type            | Description                          |
|:------------------|:----------------|:-------------------------------------|
| transmitterId     | String          | Hexadecimal string, lowercase, no separators |
| transmitterIdType | Number          | Single byte (0-255)                  |
| rssiSignature     | Array of Object | Ordered from strongest to weakest RSSI |

Each object in the rssiSignature array includes the following properties.

| Property          | Type            | Description                          |
|:------------------|:----------------|:-------------------------------------|
| receiverId        | String          | Hexadecimal string, lowercase, no separators |
| receiverIdType    | Number          | Single byte (0-255)                  |
| rssi              | Number          | In dBm                               |
| numberOfDecodings | Number          | Range of 1-255 (0 reserved)          |


### Optional Properties

A __raddec__ _may_ include any or all of the following properties.

| Property  | Type            | Description                                  |
|:----------|:----------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| timestamp | Number          | UNIX epoch (millisecond precision)           |
| packets   | Array of String | Hexadecimal string, lowercase, no duplicates |
| events    | Array of Number | Index list of associated events              |

When encoding a __raddec__, the optional properties to include must be explicitly specified, as the following example illustrates:

```javascript
let encodedRaddec = raddec.encodeAsHexString({ includeTimestamp: true,
                                               includePackets: true,
                                               includeEvents: true });
```


Supported Wireless Protocols
----------------------------

The __raddec__ library is being developed with consideration for the following protocols/standards:
- Bluetooth Low Energy (broadcaster/observer roles)
- WiFi (ex: probe requests)
- RAIN RFID
- LPWAN (various standards)
- proprietary Active RFID (ex: reelyActive)


Quick Reference
---------------

Both _identifier types_ and _event types_ are represented as numerical indexes for efficient manipulation and compact storage.

### Identifier Types

The identifier type indexes, which can be found in the _identifiers.js_ file, are as follows:

| Index | Raddec.identifiers. | Description                                  |
|:------|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| 0     | TYPE_UNKNOWN        | Unknown identifier type                      |
| 1     | TYPE_EUI64          | EUI-64 (used by reelyActive infrastructure)  |
| 2     | TYPE_EUI48          | EUI-48 (WiFi, BLE public addresses)          |
| 3     | TYPE_RND48          | Random 48-bit advertiser address (BLE)       |
| 4+    | - RESERVED -        | Reserved for future use                      |

### Event Types

The event type indexes, which can be found in the _events.js_ file, are as follows:

| Index | Raddec.events.  | Description                                         |
|:------|:----------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | APPEARANCE      | First decoding of the transmitter in recent memory  |
| 1     | DISPLACEMENT    | Change of strongest receiver by transmitter         |
| 2     | PACKETS         | New packet payload received from transmitter        |
| 3     | KEEPALIVE       | Periodic update of transmitter's recent decoding(s) |
| 4     | DISAPPEARANCE   | Transmitter no longer decoded by any receiver       |
| 5-7   | - RESERVED -    | Reserved for future use                             |


What's next?
------------

This library is currently in active development.  Expect features to be added periodically.  We recommend observing semantic versioning best practices for dependents should breaking changes be required.
